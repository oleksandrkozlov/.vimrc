# tag: (this commit will) <title in imperative>
#
# An awesome description of WHY you did this work, not HOW/WHAT it does.
# The diff attached to commit should describe implementation (HOW)
# well-enough.

# Tag can be
#   * component, utils, tests;
#   * git (git related modifications);
#   * repo (project structure modification);
#   * build (project build system modification);
#   * style (code style fixed);
#   * proj (other changes related to the project).
#
# Remember to:
#   * sign a commit;
#   * separate subject from body with a blank line;
#   * limit the subject line to 50 characters;
#   * capitalize the subject line;
#   * do not end the subject line with a period;
#   * use the imperative mood in the subject line;
#   * wrap the body at 72 characters;
#   * use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
